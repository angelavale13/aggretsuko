				<h4>Gori</h4>
					<p>This female director of marketing is talented and hardworking. She is a daunting figure on the outside, but is surprisingly delicate on the inside and often finds it hard to say what is on her mind. She dresses in cool, conservative fashion, but comments about her physical appearance hurt and she frequently cries herself to sleep at night.</p>

					<h4>Washimi</h4>
					<p>She's the talented and beautiful secretary of the President that has a knack for being able to meet all his needs. However, she is fed up with his mental weakness and the way he treats people. She is cool under pressure at work, but will 'let her feathers down' when it comes to the opposit sex. On dates, she uses her long legs to wow potential suitors, even though she soon tires of them and her relationships are inevitably short-lived.</p>

					<h4>Fenneko</h4>
					<p>She entered the company at the same time as Aggretsuko and the two vent to each other about the angst they feel toward their bosses.While they get along on the surface, Aggretsuko believes that Fenneko is a frenemy that talks behind her back. This fox can be difficult, but she is nowhere near as bad as Aggretsuko believes.</p>
